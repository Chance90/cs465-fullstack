CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

**Course Reflection**

In the Full Stack Development 1 course, I gained practical experience with various frontend and backend technologies. I worked with traditional HTML and JavaScript for structuring and adding interactivity to web pages, and explored the benefits of single-page applications (SPAs) for a more seamless user experience. On the backend, I used a NoSQL MongoDB database, which provided flexibility in data storage and scalability, particularly suitable for handling dynamic and large-scale data. JSON played a crucial role in tying together the frontend and backend, allowing for smooth data exchange in a format thatâ€™s easy to manipulate in JavaScript.

Throughout the course, I refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency, such as by creating reusable UI components that enhanced consistency and reduced redundancy across the application. I also deepened my understanding of API methods, endpoints, and the complexities of testing in a full stack application, particularly with added security layers like authentication and encryption. This course has equipped me with valuable skills in full stack development, making me a more marketable candidate in the field of web development and software engineering.
